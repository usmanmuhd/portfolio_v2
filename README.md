# 👨‍💻 Muhammad Usman's Digital Playground

Welcome to my corner of the internet! This is where I showcase my journey as a Software Engineer who enjoys turning coffee into code and bugs into features. ☕→💻

## 🚀 What's This About?

A sleek, dark-themed portfolio that doesn't hurt your eyes at 2 AM (you're welcome, fellow night owls). Built with love and caffeine.

**Live at:** [musman.dev](https://musman.dev) ✨

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - The holy trinity
- **GitHub Pages** - Because free hosting is best hosting
- **Lots of patience** - Debug tears not included

## 🎨 Features That Make Me Proud

- 🌙 **Dark theme** (because light themes are so 2010)
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly** (yes, it works on your ancient phone too)
- ⚡ **Fast loading** (faster than your microwave heating leftovers)
- 🎭 **Smooth animations** (smoother than my dance moves)

## 🤓 Fun Facts

- This portfolio has been through more iterations than my morning alarm
- The color scheme was chosen after rejecting 47 other combinations
- No CSS frameworks were harmed in the making of this website
- Tested on more devices than a tech store employee

## � What You'll Find

- My professional journey (the highlights reel)
- Cool projects I've worked on (the ones that actually work)
- Skills I've collected like Pokémon cards
- Ways to reach out (I promise I'm friendly)

## � Quick Start

Want to run this locally? It's easier than making instant noodles:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usmanmuhd/portfolio_v2.git
cd portfolio_v2
# Open index.html in your browser
# That's it! No npm install needed 🎉
```

**Made with 💙 and probably too much coffee**

*P.S. If you find any bugs, they're not bugs - they're undocumented features! 🐛→✨*
